Technologies Used:

Python
Selenium WebDriver
BeautifulSoup
CSV file handling


Features:

Automated Login: The script automates the login process to access the restricted sections of the e-commerce platform.
Dynamic Content Scraping: Utilizing Selenium WebDriver, the script navigates through the website, waits for dynamic content to load, and extracts relevant product data.
Data Analysis: RGB values are used to categorize products based on color codes, enriching the collected data with additional insights.
Continuous Data Collection: The script iterates through multiple pages of product listings, ensuring comprehensive data collection.
Data Persistence: Collected data is stored in a CSV file, allowing for easy access and further analysis.
Data Integrity: Duplicate entries are avoided by checking against existing data in the CSV file.
